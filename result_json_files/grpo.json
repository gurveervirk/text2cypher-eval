            "<reasoning>\nTo answer this question, we need to identify the filings where the originator is a country and then filter these filings to only include those from the last quarter of any year. Finally, we need to group the results by country and count the filings for each country to determine which 5 countries have the most filings.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to derive the Cypher query:\n\n1. **Identify Filings with Originator as a Country**: We will use the `:Filing` node and its relationships with `:Entity` to identify filings where the originator is a country. The `originator_bank_country` property will help us filter these filings.\n\n2. **Filter Filings from the Last Quarter of Any Year**: We need to filter the filings to only include those from the last quarter of any year. This can be done using the `begin` property, which specifies the filing date. The last quarter of any year can be represented by the dates from March 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30, October 1 to December 31, etc.\n\n3. **Group by Country and Count Filings**: Once we have the filtered filings, we will group them by the `originator_bank_country` property and count the number of filings for each country.\n\n4. **Order and Limit the Results**: Finally, we will order the results by the count of filings in descending order and limit the results to the top 5 countries.\n\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\nMATCH (f: Filing)-[r:ORIGINATOR]->(c: Country)\nWHERE r.originator_bank_country IS NOT NULL AND r.begin >= '2023-03-01' AND r.begin < '2023-09-01' OR r.begin >= '2023-09-01' AND r.begin < '2023-12-01' OR r.begin >= '2023-12-01' AND r.begin < '2024-03-01'\nRETURN c.code AS country, COUNT(f) AS filing_count\nORDER BY filing_count DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n</answer>",
            "<reasoning>\nTo answer this question, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant nodes and relationships**: We are interested in filings and their originator countries. The relationship `ORIGINATOR` connects filings to their originator entities.\n\n2. **Filter filings to the last quarter of any year**: The question specifies the last quarter of any year. We need to filter filings that ended between 2015-07-01T00:00:00Z and 2017-06-30T00:00:00Z.\n\n3. **Extract the originator country from the filings**: For each filing, we need to extract the `originator_bank_country` property, which represents the country of the originator bank.\n\n4. **Count the filings by country**: We need to count how many filings each country has.\n\n5. **Sort the countries by the number of filings in descending order**: We want the countries with the most filings to appear first.\n\n6. **Limit the results to the top 5 countries**: Finally, we limit the results to the top 5 countries with the most filings.\n\nBased on these steps, we can construct the Cypher query as follows:\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\nMATCH (f:Filing)-[o:ORIGINATOR]->(e:Entity)\nWHERE f.end >= '2015-07-01T00:00:00Z' AND f.end <= '2017-06-30T00:00:00Z'\nWITH e.country AS country, COUNT(f) AS filings\nORDER BY filings DESC\nLIMIT 5\nRETURN country, filings\n</answer>",

We can use a `WHERE` clause to filter filings based on the `begin_date`.\n\n3. **Aggregate filings by originator country**: We need to group the filings by the originator country and count the number of filings for each country.\n\n4. **Sort the countries by the number of filings in descending order**: To find the countries with the most filings, we need to sort the results in descending order by the count.\n\n5. **Limit the results to the top 5 countries**: Finally, we limit the results to the top 5 countries.\n\n6. **Select the country names**: Since we are only interested in the countries, we select the `name` property from the `Country` nodes.\n\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\nMATCH (f:Filing)-[r:ORIGINATOR]->(e:Entity)-[o:COUNTRY]->(c:Country)\nWHERE f.begin >= '2016-07-01T00:00:00Z' AND f.begin <= '2017-12-31T23:59:59Z'\nWITH c.name AS countryName, COUNT(f) AS filingCount\nORDER BY filingCount DESC\nLIMIT 5\nRETURN countryName\n</answer>",

We can use a combination of Cypher functions to achieve this.

This function will return a sentiment score based on the text.\n\n3. **Categorize sentiments**: \n   - Based on the sentiment score, categorize the sentiments as:\n     - Positive if the score is greater than 0.5\n     - Negative if the score is less than -0.5\n     - Neutral otherwise\n\n4. **Group by business and sentiment**: \n   - Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by business and sentiment.\n\n5. **Count occurrences**: \n   - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of reviews for each business and sentiment category.\n\n6. **Order by business and sentiment**: \n   - Order the results by business name and sentiment category to provide a clear visualization of the most common sentiments for each business.\n\n7. **Limit the results**: \n   - Limit the results to the top 5 businesses and their most common sentiments.\n\nBased on these steps, the Cypher query can be constructed as follows:\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nMATCH (u:User)-[:WROTE]->(r:Review)-[:REVIEWS]->(b:Business)\nWITH b.name AS businessName, r.text AS reviewText, r.stars AS reviewStars\nCALL apoc.ml.sentiment(reviewText) YIELD score\nWITH businessName, score, reviewStars\nCASE\n  WHEN score > 0.5 THEN 'Positive'\n  WHEN score < -0.5 THEN 'Negative'\n  ELSE 'Neutral'\nEND AS sentiment\nRETURN businessName, sentiment, COUNT(*) AS reviewCount\nORDER BY businessName, sentiment\nLIMIT 5\n</answer>"

            "<reasoning>\nTo answer this question, we need to identify actors who have starred in both animated and live-action movies. The relationships `ACTED_IN` with the `role` property can help us distinguish between these two types of movies. Specifically:\n- Movies with a runtime less than 40 minutes are typically considered live-action.\n- Movies with a runtime 40 minutes or more are typically considered animated.\n\nThe relationships will have a `role` property that indicates the part played in each movie. We can use this property to filter the relationships and then find actors who have starred in both types.\n\nThe Cypher query will:\n1. Match actors who have acted in movies with a runtime less than 40 minutes.\n2. Match actors who have acted in movies with a runtime 40 minutes or more.\n3.

            "<reasoning>\nTo answer this question, we need to identify actors who have acted in movies that belong to both the 'Animation' and 'Live Action' genres. Here's a step-by-step approach to derive the Cypher query:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant nodes and relationships:**\n   - `Actor` nodes will represent the actors we are interested in.\n   - `Movie` nodes will represent the movies.\n   - `Genre` nodes will represent the genres.\n   - `ACTED_IN` relationship will connect actors to movies.\n\n2. **Filter movies by genre:**\n   - We need to find movies that belong to both 'Animation' and 'Live Action' genres.\n   - This can be achieved by traversing the `IN_GENRE` relationship and collecting the `tmdbId` of movies that have both genres.\n\n3. **Find actors who have acted in these movies:**\n   - We need to find actors who have acted in any of these movies.\n   - This can be achieved by traversing the `ACTED_IN` relationship and collecting the `name` of actors who have acted in these movies.\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   - We need to find actors who have acted in movies that belong to both genres.\n   - This can be achieved by comparing the list of actors who have acted in movies that belong to 'Animation' with the list of actors who have acted in movies that belong to 'Live Action'.\n\n5. **Remove duplicates:**\n   - Since we are interested in actors who have acted in movies that belong to both genres, we need to remove any duplicates from the final list.\n\n6. **Limit the results:**\n   - We can limit the results to a certain number of actors to get a concise answer.\n\nBased on these steps, the Cypher query can be derived as follows:\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\nMATCH (a:Actor)\nWHERE (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(:Genre {name: \"Animation\"})\n  AND (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(:Genre {name: \"Live Action\"})\nRETURN DISTINCT a.name\nLIMIT 5\n</answer>",

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the Cypher query is generated:\n\n1. **Identify the relationships involved**: The relationships `ACTED_IN` and `DIRECTED` are relevant because they connect actors to movies.\n\n2. **Identify the properties of the movies**: The properties `title` and `tagline` of the movies can help distinguish between animated and live-action films. Animated films often have a tagline that indicates they are a sequel, prequel, or spin-off of an existing film.\n\n3. **Define the criteria for animated and live-action films**: \n   - Animated films typically have a tagline that includes words like \"sequel\", \"prequel\", \"spin-off\", \"extended\", or \"part\".\n   - Live-action films generally have a tagline that describes the plot or the main character.\n\n4. **Construct the Cypher query**: \n   - Match actors who have acted in movies with a tagline indicating an animated film.\n   - Match actors who have acted in movies with a tagline indicating a live-action film.\n   - Use the `UNION` operator to combine the results from both sets of matches.\n\n5. **Filter to find common actors**: \n   - Use the `INTERSECT` operator to find actors who have acted in both sets of movies.\n\nThe resulting Cypher query will list the actors who have starred in both animated and live-action movies.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\nMATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m1:Movie {tagline: (m1.title CONTAINS \"sequel\") OR (m1.title CONTAINS \"prequel\") OR (m1.title CONTAINS \"spin-off\") OR (m1.title CONTAINS \"extended\") OR (m1.title CONTAINS \"part\")})\nMATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m2:Movie {tagline: (m2.title CONTAINS \"sequel\") OR (m2.title CONTAINS \"prequel\") OR (m2.title CONTAINS \"spin-off\") OR (m2.title CONTAINS \"extended\") OR (m2.title CONTAINS \"part\")})\nMATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m3:Movie {tagline: (m3.title CONTAINS \"plot\") OR (m3.title CONTAINS \"character\")})\nWHERE m1 <> m2\nWITH a\nINTERSECT\nMATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m1:Movie {tagline: (m1.title CONTAINS \"sequel\") OR (m1.title CONTAINS \"prequel\") OR (m1.title CONTAINS \"spin-off\") OR (m1.title CONTAINS \"extended\") OR (m1.title CONTAINS \"part\")})\nMATCH (a:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m2:Movie {tagline: (m2.title CONTAINS \"plot\") OR (m2.title CONTAINS \"character\")})\nWHERE m1 <> m2\nRETURN DISTINCT a.name AS actorName\nORDER BY actorName\n</answer>",

            "<reasoning>\nTo answer this question, we need to find filings where both the originator bank and the beneficiary bank are located in countries that are members of the European Union. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the Cypher query is generated:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant relationships and properties:**\n   - We need to access the `Filing` node properties `originator_bank`, `beneficiary_bank`, `originator_bank_country`, and `beneficiary_bank_country`.\n   - We also need to access the `Country` node properties `code` and `tld` to identify the country codes and top-level domains.\n\n2. **Use the UNION operator:**\n   - Since we want to find filings where both banks are in the same country, we will use the UNION operator to combine the results of two separate queries:\n     - One query to find filings where the `originator_bank` is in the EU.\n     - Another query to find filings where the `beneficiary_bank` is in the EU.\n\n3. **Filter filings where both banks are in the same country:**\n   - For each query, we will filter the results to only include filings where the `originator_bank_country` and `beneficiary_bank_country` are the same.\n\n4. **Specify the conditions for the European Union:**\n   - The European Union (EU) countries are typically represented by their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.\n   - We will create a list of EU country codes and use the `IN` operator to filter the results.\n\n5. **Construct the Cypher queries:**\n   - Query 1: Find filings where the `originator_bank` is in the EU.\n     ```cypher\n     MATCH (f:Filing)-[:ORIGINATOR]->(e:Entity)-[:COUNTRY]->(c:Country)\n     WHERE c.code IN ['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'HR', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DK', 'EE', 'FI', 'FR', 'GR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IM', 'IS', 'IT', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MT', 'MU', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'ES', 'CH', 'GB', 'AU', 'BR', 'MX', 'CA', 'US']\n     AND c.code = f.originator_bank_country\n     RETURN f\n     ```\n   - Query 2: Find filings where the `beneficiary_bank` is in the EU.\n     ```cypher\n     MATCH (f:Filing)-[:BENEFITS]->(e:Entity)-[:COUNTRY]->(c:Country)\n     WHERE c.code IN ['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'HR', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DK', 'EE', 'FI', 'FR', 'GR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IM', 'IS', 'IT', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MT', 'MU', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'ES', 'CH', 'GB', 'AU', 'BR', 'MX', 'CA', 'US']\n     AND c.code = f.beneficiary_bank_country\n     RETURN f\n     ```\n   - Combine the results using UNION:\n     ```cypher\n     MATCH (f:Filing)-[:ORIGINATOR]->(e:Entity)-[:COUNTRY]->(c:Country)\n     WHERE c.code IN ['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'HR', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DK', 'EE', 'FI', 'FR', 'GR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IM', 'IS', 'IT', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MT', 'MU', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'ES', 'CH', 'GB', 'AU', 'BR', 'MX', 'CA', 'US']\n     AND c.code = f.originator_bank_country\n     RETURN f\n     UNION\n     MATCH (f:Filing)-[:BENEFITS]->(e:Entity)-[:COUNTRY]->(c:Country)\n     WHERE c.code IN ['AT', 'BE', 'BG', 'HR', 'CY', 'CZ', 'DK', 'EE', 'FI', 'FR', 'GR', 'HU', 'IE', 'IM', 'IS', 'IT', 'LT', 'LU', 'LV', 'MT', 'MU', 'NL', 'NO', 'PL', 'PT', 'RO', 'SE', 'SI', 'ES', 'CH', 'GB', 'AU', 'BR', 'MX', 'CA', 'US']\n     AND c.code = f.beneficiary_bank_country\n     RETURN f",

Based on the schema, these properties are stored in the `Character` node properties: `pagerank` and `degree`. The question specifies that these characters should be identified for the top 5 results.\n\nTo achieve this, the Cypher query will:\n1. Match nodes of type `Character`.\n2. Filter nodes where both `pagerank` and `degree` meet or exceed a certain threshold (which we will assume to be the minimum value in the schema, as no specific threshold is provided).\n3. Limit the results to the top 5 characters based on these criteria.\n\nThe minimum `pagerank` value in the schema is 0.15000000000000002, and the minimum `degree` value is 0.0. However, since the question asks for \"high\" values, we will consider any value above these minimums to represent \"high\".\n\nThe Cypher query will look like this:\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nMATCH (c:Character)\nWHERE c.pagerank > 0.15 AND c.degree > 0\nRETURN c.name, c.pagerank, c.degree\nORDER BY c.pagerank DESC, c.degree DESC\nLIMIT 5\n</answer>",
            "<reasoning>\nTo answer this question, we need to find characters who have both a high pagerank and a high degree centrality. The relationships `INTERACTS`, `INTERACTS1`, `INTERACTS2`, `INTERACTS3`, and `INTERACTS45` all connect characters, so we can examine these relationships to determine their centrality and pagerank.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the Cypher query is generated:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant relationships**: We'll focus on the relationships that connect characters (`INTERACTS`, `INTERACTS1`, `INTERACTS2`, `INTERACTS3`, `INTERACTS45`).\n\n2. **Select the character properties**: We're interested in the `pagerank` and `degree` properties of the characters.\n\n3. **Apply the conditions**: We need to filter characters who have a pagerank above a certain threshold and a degree centrality above a certain threshold. Since the exact thresholds are not provided, we'll assume that any character with a pagerank above 0.5 and a degree centrality above 100 will meet the criteria.\n\n4. **Limit the results**: We want to limit the results to the top 5 characters.\n\nBased on these steps, the Cypher query is:\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\nMATCH (c:Character)\nWHERE c.pagerank > 0.5 AND c.degree > 100\nRETURN c.name, c.pagerank, c.degree\nORDER BY c.pagerank DESC, c.degree DESC\nLIMIT 5\n</answer>",
            "<reasoning>\nThe task is to find characters who have both a high pagerank and a high degree of centrality. Based on the schema, the relevant properties are:\n- `pagerank`: FLOAT Min: 0.15000000000000002, Max: 9.473142454730429\n- `degree`: FLOAT Min: 0.0, Max: 300.0\n\nThe relationships `INTERACTS`, `INTERACTS1`, `INTERACTS2`, `INTERACTS3`, and `INTERACTS45` are used to connect characters, but they do not directly provide centrality or pagerank values. However, the relationships imply interactions, which could indirectly influence these properties.\n\nTo find characters with high pagerank and high centrality, we would typically look at the properties `pagerank` and `degree` directly. Since the relationships do not provide these properties, we can infer that characters with high pagerank and high centrality might have interacted frequently in the most recent book (book 45) or at a later stage.\n\nThe Cypher query would involve selecting characters based on the `pagerank` and `degree` properties, but since the relationships do not directly provide these properties, the query would need to consider the overall network properties. However, based on the schema and the relationships provided, a more straightforward approach would be to directly query the properties `pagerank` and `degree`.\n\nThe final query would be:\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nMATCH (c:Character)\nWHERE c.pagerank > 0.15 AND c.degree > 0.0\nRETURN c.name, c.pagerank, c.degree\nORDER BY c.pagerank DESC, c.degree DESC\nLIMIT 5\n</answer>",

This can be done using the `COUNT` function on the `(User)` nodes connected to the stream.\n\n3. **Order the streams**: To find the streams with the most chatters, we need to order the results by the count of chatters in descending order.\n\n4. **Limit the results**: Finally, we limit the results to the top 3 streams with the most chatters.\n\n5. **Select the required properties**: We only need the `name` of the streams to meet the user's request.\n\nThe Cypher query is derived by combining these steps:\n- `MATCH (s:Stream)-[:CHATTER]->(u:User)`: This pattern matches all streams and their chatters.\n- `WITH s, COUNT(u) AS chatterCount`: This calculates the number of chatters for each stream.\n- `ORDER BY chatterCount DESC`: This orders the streams by the number of chatters in descending order.\n- `LIMIT 3`: This limits the results to the top 3 streams.\n- `RETURN s.name`: This selects the names of the streams with the most chatters.\n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nMATCH (s:Stream)-[:CHATTER]->(u:User)\nWITH s, COUNT(u) AS chatterCount\nORDER BY chatterCount DESC\nLIMIT 3\nRETURN s.name\n</answer>",
